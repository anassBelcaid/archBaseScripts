# Simple scripts for linux installation and configuration #

In this repository, I will put my linux **scripts** to easely setup a new
machine. mainly the distribution of choice is `arch linux`.

## Configuration ##

1. [asound](config/install_alsa_mixer.sh) : By default `arch` choose the wrong sound card. So the script correct that.
2. [backlight](config/install_xbacklight.sh) : will install the `xbacklight`
   and add two commands to controle the brightness.
3. [Monitor dpi](config/configure_monitor.sh)
4. [Keyboard](config/configure_keyboard.sh)
