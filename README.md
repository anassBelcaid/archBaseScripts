# Simple scripts for linux installation and configuration #

In this repository, I will put my linux **scripts** to easely setup a new
machine. mainly the distribution of choice is `arch linux`.

## Configuration ##

1. [asound](config/instal_alsa_mixer.sh) : By default `arch` choose the wrong sound card. So the script correct that.
